# Vue_bits

A set of vuejs components, bits, and other code I made that can be quite useful.  Each item is self-contained and commented to include usage examples and other explanations if needed

## circle_clock.js

A count-up pie clock of sorts drawn using SVG paths.  The fill of the pie is based on the input percentage.  The foreground and background colors can be changed.

## fancy_multi_switch.js

A switch that can have as many switch positions as desired, just add a label (String) to the array.  Clicking that position will return the corrosponding position number of that value in the array.

There is also an optional lock which can be enabled to prevent changing the switch without unlocking it first.
